        <h4>Electric bikes are trending</h4>
        “Riding the bike for the first time, I was nervous,” she said. “I had ridden stationary bikes, but going from a
        stationary bike to a real bike was a little nerve-racking at first. But the ride was extremely smooth, and
        knowing that any second if I was getting tired or my muscles or knees were beginning to hurt I could turn on the
        motor and be okay made me feel safer.
        She says her family is very active, hiking and biking regularly, but she has always stayed behind because she
        didn’t have the muscle strength to keep up. That’s all changed now.
        Now, I can go with them, and if my muscles fail me, I can turn on the motor.

        A great feeling to know that the more often I ride the bike and take it places, I’m strengthening up these
        muscles.”
        Chantel says she’s thrilled to be back on two wheels and would recommend an e-bike to anyone, no matter their
        level of fitness. </p>

        <p>I think the Charge e-bike is great for a wide variety of people whether you just want to have fun, or you’re
            someone like me who has had extensive surgery and who needs a lot of physical therapy and is trying to build
            back muscle mass and strength,” she says. “You know you’ll never be stuck somewhere, and if you get nervous
            or scared or tired, you can use the pedal assist to help you get back to where you came from or to keep
            going. I would recommend the charge e-bike to everyone.”
