    <p>Austin is a lively, fun city, with a lot of unique things to see and do. Plus, nothing is more than 20 minutes
        away from anywhere else, so you won’t be spending ages getting around like in huge metropolises.

        To help you pick the best place to stay during your trip, here’s my list of the best hotels in Austin</p>
    <p>East Austin is an energetic area that’s a great place to stay if you like dining out (some of my favorite spots
        are Fukomoto, Via 313, and Counter Cafe). This boutique property has 75 rooms with a minimalist Scandinavian
        design featuring soft pastel colors and wooden accents throughout. Amenities include Casper mattresses, plush
        robes, in-room coffeemakers, and vintage décor. There’s also a small outdoor pool complete with a poolside
        cocktail bar, as well as a rooftop bar and restaurant. Plus, it’s right on lively East Sixth Street, which is
        one of the best places to go out on in the city.</p>
    <p>This hotel is in Downtown Austin, an area you’ll want to stay in if you want to be close to most of the city’s
        attractions. It’s also just a stone’s throw away from Stubb’s, a world-famous music venue (try to see a show
        there if you can). Indigo is a stylish and creatively designed hotel with a rooftop swimming pool and bar, as
        well as a 24-hour fitness center. The colorful and spacious rooms feature comfortable beds, a work desk,
        flat-screen TV with premium channels, and luxury bath products in the sizable showers.
